# Icarus Wings

*Since ancient times, people have dreamed of being able to fly like a bird.*

## Background

I want to fly in Eden Ring world ([Eden Ring is a fabric mod](https://github.com/paulevsGitch/EdenRing)) but the Elytra is too rare.

So I would like to add an equip which has the same funtionality.

I take inspiration from ancient Greek mythology, *Wings of Icarus*.

In my imagination, that is a wing crafting by Feather and Honeycomb.
